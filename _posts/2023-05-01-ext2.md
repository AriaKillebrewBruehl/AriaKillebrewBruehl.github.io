Final project for Operating Systems class completed with Caden Corontzos. This project builds on an Implementation of Ext2 in Rust. We started with the code given to the class and set out to expand and improve the functionality. This is a summary of what we did and the process.

We ended up cleaning up the code to have functions for all the input commands. We also implemented a follow path function so that when you `ls` or `cd`, you can provide a file path instead of being limited to only files in the current directory. We also implemented cat and a limited version of mkdir. These improvements are detailed in the Design and Implementation section below.

Here's an example session:

```
:> ls
.      ..      lost+found      test_directory  hello.txt
:> cd test_directory
:> ls
.      ..      file_in_folder.txt
:> cd ..
:> cat test_directory/file_in_folder.txt
Hello! I'm a file inside a folder.
:> ls
PU      ..      lost+found      test_directory
:> mkdir hello
:> ls
.      ..      lost+found      test_directory  hello.txt       hello
:>
```
