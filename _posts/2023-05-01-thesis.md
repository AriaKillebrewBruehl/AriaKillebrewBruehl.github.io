For my thesis I considered the automatic generation of hedcut style portraits using
photographs of faces. These renderings mimic [those that appear in the Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/whats-in-a-hedcut-depends-how-its-made-11576537243) which are produced by hand with pen and ink. I begin this work by following
[Kim et al.](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-13544-6_17&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1689361687396235&usg=AOvVaw353E4GYy9igeK-XScLTizj) who render hedcuts by placing stipples so they follow not only the outline
of facial features but also isophotes (lines with constant illumination). I apply a
variety of image processing techniques to extract facial components and inform stipple
placement and size to illustrate tone and depth of the face. I then expand on the work
of Kim et al. by introducing an interactive tool that allows for a fully parameterizable
version of their approach. Finally I experimented with allowing for areas of negative
space and areas of stipple density variation. In this thesis I report on this tool and
assess the quality of these methods.
